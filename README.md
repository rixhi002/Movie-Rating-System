# Movie Rating System using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a movie rating system using machine learning techniques. The system will predict user ratings for movies based on various features such as genre, cast, director, release year, and user preferences.

## Introduction

The Movie Rating System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations and predict user ratings for unseen movies. It employs machine learning algorithms to analyze movie features and user behavior to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of movie metadata including features such as title, genre, cast, director, release year, and user ratings. The dataset is available in [data/movies.csv](data/movies.csv).
